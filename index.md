## Introduction

I am a 2nd year MS student in the Human Paleobiology Program at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. I have a background in biology and archaeology and am interested in researching human evolution through the study of genetics and genomics. 

## Research Interests

My interests focus on the evolution of genes involved in metabolism and the evolution of diet within the human lineage. I am currently working on a Master's thesis examining the evolution of potential functional variation in starch-digesting enzymes in humans and non-human primates. Moving forward, I plan to shift my focus to population genetic and genomic analyses of modern-day populations to examine regional variation in metabolic-related genes, such as the *FADS* gene cluster. Additionally, I am interested in incorporating ecological and demographic history to determine if introgression from archaic hominins played a role in unique haplotypes seen within these genes in the regions of Southeast Asia and Oceania. 

## Outreach

Outside of the lab, I am a strong proponent of science education to help inform understanding of human evolutionary concepts and advancements in human evolutionary genetics for the general public. To this end, I have been involved in several forms of outreach including:

- Acting as a visiting reseacher for the *Scientist in In* program at the National Museum of Natural History
- Cohosting [Evolution's Grad Girls](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCBhCOoJCOEm0ahysB7Bxyw), a short webseries on Youtube answering Reddit questions related to evolutionary anthropology
